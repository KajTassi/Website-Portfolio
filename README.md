# Personal Website and Portfolio

This project was created with JavaScript, React.js, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to house past projects and as an opportunity to work on front end design. It houses my most recent and accomplished projects. I am still continue to work everyday on either volunteer work or independant projects, so those will continue to be updated.
